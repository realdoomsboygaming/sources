# Aidoku Community Sources

This repository hosts unofficial sources maintained by community members that are installable in [Aidoku](https://github.com/Aidoku/Aidoku).

## Usage

On a device with Aidoku (0.7+) installed, you can open [this link](https://aidoku.app/add-source-list/?url=https://aidoku-community.github.io/sources/index.min.json) to add the source list directly to the app.

Otherwise, navigate to the settings tab, and under the source lists page add `https://aidoku-community.github.io/sources/index.min.json`.

If a source is not working, or you want to request a source that isn't available in this source list, feel free to [create a new issue](https://github.com/Aidoku-Community/sources/issues).
